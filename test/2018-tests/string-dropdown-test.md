### string-dropdown input type testing

* when free text mode is enabled and some value is entered in free text mode - next time when form is open dropdown doesn't show that value, because it's not in free text mode. When free text is enabled then the value is shown.
* when an input field is required than in old form empty default value doesn't exist, but now empty value exist. (it's not a problem, but maybe not desired behavior)
* can't set empty value text - need to set some message
