### entity-default input type testing

* when an entity is required it doesn't open autocomplete
* when a new entity is created all dialogs are closed ??? Need to close the entity dialog only and refresh.
* the entity without decorations is hidden
* when an entity is removed we need to refresh all other entities in the form.
* drag doesn't work on a mobile phone
